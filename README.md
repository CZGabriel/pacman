<h1>Pacman Project</h1>
<body><i>This is an assignment I completed for my MIT xPro course: <b>Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohort</b></i></body>

<h1>Description</h1>
<body>
The assignment was to create a pacman animation that moved back and forth across the screen, opening and closing its mouth. To do this, we used 4 images and had to edit the starter code to identify the borders on the screen and make the animation respond.
  <p><p>
We had to use function, arrays, objects, and loops to accomplish this.
